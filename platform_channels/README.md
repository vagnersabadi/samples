# Platform Channel Samples

A sample app which demonstrates how to use `MethodChannel`, `EventChannel`, `BasicMessageChannel` and `MessageCodec` in Flutter.

This sample is currently being built. Not all platforms and functionality are in place.

## Goals

* Demonstrate how to use `MethodChannel` to invoke platform methods.
* Demonstrate how to use `EventChannel` to listen continuous value changes from the platform.
* Demonstrate how to use `BasicMessageChanngel` and `MessageCodec` to send messages of different types across the platform.
